# Storefront-Server

## Problem Domain

This is the 3rd part part of a 4-Phase build of the storefront application. In this first phase, I setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and behaviors. I organized the file structure and state management so that the application can be expanded upon in a scalable manner. In phase 2, I implemented the the “Add to Cart” feature, which allows the user to select products and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase. In phase 3, I connect my application to a live server. 

## User Stories

As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products

As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category

As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence

As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart

As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart 

As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart

As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart


As a user, I want to interact with live inventory so that I have confidence that the displayed products are in stock

As a user, I want to know to that when I add an item to my cart, that it is removed from inventory so that no other users can purchase it

## Contributions

This server was initally constructed in class with the help of my fellow classmates, but it was not fully functional. I refactored the server and completed the routes and models so that it was able to connect to the front-end and process requests from the client.
